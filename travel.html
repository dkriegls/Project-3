          <h3><strong>1.Ecuador</strong></h3>      
	</div>
        <p>
         Ecuador is  great place to travel to because it is so diverse. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The country is small and has a variety of landscapes. From mountains to beaches 
          that are around a 4 hour drive to each other.

          <h3><strong>Mexico </strong></h3>
        </div>	  
        <p>
         Mexico has around 32 states that are quite diverse. There is so much to see that
         I would recommend you take a road trip.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of my favorite places to visit is Mexico city. Since it is a mega city and has
         a lot to offer.

          <h3><strong>Canada </strong></h3>
	</div>
        <p>
          Canada is a huge country to travel to. I enjoy taking road trips there.
          Since it is only a couple of hours from here
        </p>
        <p>
          I usually just drive to Toronto or Montreal. But i prefer Toronto.

          <h3><strong>NYC</strong></h3>     
	</div>
        <p>
         Nyc is one of the best places you can visit. It is such a large city full of life. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The food,people, and smell give it some character. I would recommend everyone to visit nyc 
          at least once in their life.
